# Mods Support

You can freely develop mods for Pony House. Users will have to install these mods by placing files in a separate folder. But if you want, you can build a client with these mods already pre-installed like a patch. The patched version by default does not allow the user to uninstall your mods.

Features are still under development. I will update this file with more information during the time.
